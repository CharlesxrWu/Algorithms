## Balanced Binary Tree「LeetCode 110」

题目：判断一个二叉树是否是平衡二叉树

```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree 

in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
```

解题思路：递归思想

1. 平衡二叉树的左右子树的高度相差不超过 1
2.
